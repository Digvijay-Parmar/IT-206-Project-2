- As lines are clearing levels increases and as levels increase so will power of gravity i.e.speed of bolcks.
## Demo

video recording of game demostration is added in reposatery of project

- Though there is many similarites with Project 1 but beside that there is some new Lessons and challanges like making tetrominoes with help of 2-D vectors, handling the blocks falling, Giving colours different cells of block etc.

That is all about Project 2 now play and enjoy tetris game ðŸš€.
